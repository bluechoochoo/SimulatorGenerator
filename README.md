SimulatorGenerator
==================

Inspired by [John Walker's review of Woodcutter Simulator](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/07/john-vs-the-trees-woodcutter-simulator-2013/), this bot procedurally generates box art for hot new games in the growing Job Simulator genre.

It can also take requests! Tweet at it using the phrase "make one about" and it will respond back within a couple minutes. 

* "@SimGenerator Make one about Ron Paul, please." 
* "Hey, @SimGenerator, make one about a sweet ninja." 
* _Et cetera_. 

Note that it won't respond to any requests featuring words from [Darius Kazemi's word filter](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter). It also makes some rudimentary efforts to avoid shock images and jokes that I've seen too much. 

If something goes wrong, it just silently ignores the request. Alas. Tweet [@OptimistPanda](http://twitter.com/OptimistPanda) if you think it's broken.
